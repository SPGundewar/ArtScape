# ask gpt to -
# This is intentionally minimal but correct: create artworks, list, get, and mark_sold. 
# For demo authentication, create_artwork expects X-Username header (easier than decoding JWT here).
# You can replace with JWT decode if you want full enforcement. But Orders will call mark_sold 
# without auth in the demo â€” acceptable for A2. 
# If you prefer, later we can add token verification by decoding JWT using SECRET_KEY.
